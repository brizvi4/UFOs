# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn how to take data that is stored as a JavaScript array and create a table to organize information. Users will also have the option to display the data accroding to the information they enter in the filters. The filters which the users can use are date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. In this module, we reviewed how to display default data in the table, listen for a button click or trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria. I also used HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a webpage that is visually appealing. 

## Results

When users first open the webpage, they will see an unfiltered table. Besides the tables, there will be multiple filters where users can enter data.

Users will enter date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO and the table will be filtered to show the information they have entered. This easy to use table will be very helpful for users to search for UFOs.

## Summary

- One drawback of the search field is that it is "case-sensitive". Some users might face trouble in retrieving data if they do not enter the data exactly how it is stored. 
- Maybe a filter named "Lates Sighitng" can be added so that users know of recent UFOs sightings.
- Another way to make this better is to make further customization on the filters. For instance, if drop down menus are used on filters, it will be easier for users as this will make it more interactive.
